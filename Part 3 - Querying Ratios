After having understood the relationship between Employee Count vs Average Salary, we will look into how the employees of the two colleges compare overall
to the entire university's employees in terms of count.

(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Name)  as cnt, College, Year
FROM salaries_final
GROUP BY College, Year)

SELECT College, 
Year, 
cnt, 
(SUM(`cnt`) OVER (PARTITION BY Year)) AS cntpartition,
(cnt/(SUM(cnt) OVER (PARTITION BY Year))) as 'College Employee Ratio'
FROM t1

ORDER BY Year desc

Immediately, we are able to notice that in 2020, more than half the employees of the University are from COM. To understand the relationship of change
between  the counts of the Employees of the two colleges to that of the university, it will be easier to view in chart form.


What the chart shows is that over time, COM employees increased up to 50% of all employees(as has been mentioned) by 2020, but CAS Employees sharply
decline from approximately 33% in 2009 to 20% in 2020.
