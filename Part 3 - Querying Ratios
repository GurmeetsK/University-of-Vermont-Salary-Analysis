To do this,we use the below query:

(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Name)  as cnt, College, Year
FROM salaries_final
GROUP BY College, Year)

SELECT College, 
Year, 
cnt, 
(SUM(`cnt`) OVER (PARTITION BY Year)) AS cntpartition,
(cnt/(SUM(cnt) OVER (PARTITION BY Year))) as 'College Employee Ratio'
FROM t1

ORDER BY Year desc

Immediately, we are able to notice that in 2020, more than half the employees of the University are from COM. To understand the relationship of change between 
the counts of the Employees of the two colleges to that of the university, I created the chart on Tableau Public below:



What the chart shows is that over time, COM employees increased up to 50% of all employees(as has been mentioned) by 2020, but CAS Employees sharply decline 
From approximately 33% in 2009 to 20% in 2020.
