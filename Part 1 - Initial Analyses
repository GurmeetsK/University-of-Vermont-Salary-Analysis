Using salary date provided on Kaggle of the University of Vermont's various colleges and their respecive employee/pay, I reverse engineer answers to
find out if employees of the College of Arts and Science(CAS), are, indeed being cut down and being paid less.


To begin with, I wanted a university-wide brief overview of salary and employee details, hence, the query below:

**SELECT**
	College,
	COUNT(DISTINCT `NAME`) AS 'Number of Employees',
	Max(`Base Pay`) as 'Highest Salary', 
	Min(`Base Pay`) as 'Lowest Salary',
        Avg(`Base Pay`) as 'Average Salary',
        Year
FROM salaries_final
GROUP BY College, Year
ORDER BY Year asc**

To narrow it down to only CAS, I rectify the query to have a WHERE clause;

SELECT 
	College,
	COUNT(DISTINCT `NAME`) AS 'Number of Employees',
	Max(`Base Pay`) as 'Highest Salary', 
	Min(`Base Pay`) as 'Lowest Salary',
        Avg(`Base Pay`) as 'Average Salary',
        Year
FROM salaries_final
WHERE College = 'CAS'
GROUP BY College, Year
ORDER BY Year asc

Answer: We see that the Average Base Salary for CAS in 2009 is $70981.03. In 2020 it has a steady growth to $88622.67. The employee count also grows from 246 to 359.
Though the growth is steady, we should compare it to other colleges to see if it matches. 

From the  university-wide query, we notice that the College of Medicine(COM) has a substantial number of employees. To narrow it down to just COM,
we will use a similar query as we did for CAS, except we will change the WHERE clause to 'COM':

SELECT 
	College,
	COUNT(DISTINCT `NAME`) AS 'Number of Employees',
	Max(`Base Pay`) as 'Highest Salary', 
	Min(`Base Pay`) as 'Lowest Salary',
        Avg(`Base Pay`) as 'Average Salary',
        Year
FROM salaries_final
WHERE College = 'COM'
GROUP BY College, Year
ORDER BY Year asc
