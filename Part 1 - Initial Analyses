Using salary date provided on Kaggle of the University of Vermont's various colleges and their respecive employee/pay, I reverse engineer answers to
find out if employees of the College of Arts and Science(CAS), are, indeed being cut down and being paid less.


To begin with, I wanted a university-wide brief overview of salary and employee details, hence, the query below:

SELECT
	College,
	COUNT(DISTINCT `NAME`) AS 'Number of Employees',
	Max(`Base Pay`) as 'Highest Salary', 
	Min(`Base Pay`) as 'Lowest Salary',
        Avg(`Base Pay`) as 'Average Salary',
        Year
FROM salaries_final
GROUP BY College, Year
ORDER BY Year asc**

To narrow it down to only CAS, I rectify the query to have a WHERE clause;

SELECT 
	College,
	COUNT(DISTINCT `NAME`) AS 'Number of Employees',
	Max(`Base Pay`) as 'Highest Salary', 
	Min(`Base Pay`) as 'Lowest Salary',
        Avg(`Base Pay`) as 'Average Salary',
        Year
FROM salaries_final
WHERE College = 'CAS'
GROUP BY College, Year
ORDER BY Year asc

Answer: We see that the Average Base Salary for CAS in 2009 is $70981.03. In 2020 it has a steady growth to $88622.67. The employee count also grows from 246 to 359.
Though the growth is steady, we should compare it to other colleges to see if it matches. 

From the  university-wide query, we notice that the College of Medicine(COM) has a substantial number of employees. To narrow it down to just COM,
we will use a similar query as we did for CAS, except we will change the WHERE clause to 'COM':

SELECT 
	College,
	COUNT(DISTINCT `NAME`) AS 'Number of Employees',
	Max(`Base Pay`) as 'Highest Salary', 
	Min(`Base Pay`) as 'Lowest Salary',
        Avg(`Base Pay`) as 'Average Salary',
        Year
FROM salaries_final
WHERE College = 'COM'
GROUP BY College, Year
ORDER BY Year asc

Answer: Odd enough, we see two contrastting pecularities. We see that the average salary goes down from 68445.76 in 2009 to 57744.02 in 2020. On the other hand,
The growth of Employees at COM seems to be much larger than at CAS. With 290 Employees in 2009 to 899 Employees in 2020. This could be down to the Law of Averages.
As the employees increase, the average salary would decrease. In another query, for Business, we notice that the Average Base Pay for the Business School is consistently above approximately
120,000 and the Employee count is always below 40.

Another reason could be that Colleges that are focused on growth students, programs, and employees alike require more administrative employees than others.

I will analyze these ideas in Part 2.
