What we found from Part 1 was that as COM's employee count increased, its average salary decreased. I purpose that this is due to the Law of Averages.
I also suggest that Universities that increase in employees indicate a higher need for administrative employees. I test this suggestion through Case
Statements, in which I use CAS and COM for the years 2009 and 2020 below.


CAS 2009:

SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Number of Employees', 
	CASE
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 400000 THEN 'Above 400k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 300000 THEN 'Above 300k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 200000 THEN 'Above 200k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` >100000 THEN 'Above 100k'
        WHEN `Base Pay` <=100000  THEN 'Below 100k'
    END AS 'Salary Comparison'
    FROM salaries_final
    WHERE Year = 2009
    AND College LIKE 'CAS'
    GROUP BY `Salary Comparison`;
    
    
CAS 2020:

    SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Number of Employees', 
	CASE
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 400000 THEN 'Above 400k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 300000 THEN 'Above 300k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 200000 THEN 'Above 200k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` >100000 THEN 'Above 100k'
        WHEN `Base Pay` <=100000  THEN 'Below 100k'
    END AS 'Salary Comparison'
    FROM salaries_final
    WHERE Year = 2020
    AND College LIKE 'CAS'
    GROUP BY `Salary Comparison`;
    
    
    COM 2009:

    SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Number of Employees', 
	CASE
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 400000 THEN 'Above 400k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 300000 THEN 'Above 300k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 200000 THEN 'Above 200k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` >100000 THEN 'Above 100k'
        WHEN `Base Pay` <=100000  THEN 'Below 100k'
    END AS 'Salary Comparison'
    FROM salaries_final
    WHERE Year = 2009
    AND College LIKE 'CAS'
    GROUP BY `Salary Comparison`;
    
    COM 2020
   
       SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Number of Employees', 
	CASE
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 400000 THEN 'Above 400k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 300000 THEN 'Above 300k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` > 200000 THEN 'Above 200k'
		WHEN `Base Pay` >100000 THEN 'Above 100k'
        WHEN `Base Pay` <=100000  THEN 'Below 100k'
    END AS 'Salary Comparison'
    FROM salaries_final
    WHERE Year = 2020
    AND College LIKE 'COM'
    GROUP BY `Salary Comparison`;


Putting this in chart form, we are immediately able to notice that the percentage of Employees at CAS drops down from 87% in 2009 to 68% in 2020.
At COM, the number increases to 85% from 78%. 

After confirming these notions, we want to compare the Ratio of CAS Employees to total University employees vs. that of COM Employees to the University.
We want to do this to understand how the employee count and salary change over time for both colleges. This will be done in Part 3.
